# Content sources

Where the launch content in `scripts/seed/*.ts` comes from. Rules: facts only (a name, an area, what it
is known for), nothing copied word for word, no ratings, prices or reviews. Shops close and move, so
every place is flagged `is_seed` and the app's verify flow is how real people correct it
(`select purge_seed_data();` removes the lot).

(for example Narayanganj, Gazipur, Chandpur, Noakhali, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon) have no places yet.
